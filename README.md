# Re:Charge 

## Overview

Recharge is an innovative application developed during a hackathon with a focus on student wellness. It provides a unique way for students to visualize and manage their energy levels throughout the day. Using the metaphor of a "battery" starting at 100%, users can allocate their energy across various activities and responsibilities, enabling a balanced distribution of their time and effort.

## Features

- Energy Battery: Start each day with a 100% charge and distribute your energy across different categories.

- Customizable Categories: Tailor your energy categories to match your daily activities, such as study, exercise, social time, and rest.

- Energy Insights: Get insights into your energy distribution patterns over time to make informed decisions about where to allocate your efforts.

- Daily Reflections: Log daily reflections to track your wellness journey and identify trends in your energy levels.

## Lessons learned

Have project repo, authentication, database and any non prompt related work finished before a hackathon starts. Time is extremely limited, and any time spent working on these aspects of a project can cut into your ability to complete your application.

Introduce your team to the repository, tech stack and paradigm before the hackathon starts. It's important that the team is familiar and prepared to work with all of the technologies involved so that development can happen smoothly.

Overall, an incredibly memorable experience. Thanks to the team for all the support, laughs and incredible dedication during our first hackathon, and for making it all happen.
